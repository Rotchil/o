        <img src = "images/Haiti.jpg" alt=" Haiti ">
        <p>Haiti is the second largest island in the Greater Antilles after Cuba. Haiti is therefore limited to the east by the Dominican Republic, but bordered on all sides by the Atlantic and the Caribbrn Sea. It's true that Haiti's difficulties are considerably higher than those of the Dominican Republic, whith Haiti remaining the poorest country in the America. Even those things, I love my country very much and I am working on doing something for it.</p>
